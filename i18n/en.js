I was surprised by our relationship and felt that it could be more intimate. I was wrong.',
        3: 'I confessed to her. I was very nervous about her response, and she was surely nervous about my confession. I didn\'t even want a relationship, by then I just wanted to know what she thought about me. She couldn\'t even answer me, she told me that we would talk about it on WhatsApp.',
        4: 'Yes. She told me she liked me but not in the same way as me. I was devastated. I got home and the first thing that occurred to me was to sob. I fell asleep with the weight of everything. I woke up, and I was very discouraged. I didn\'t feel like doing anything. I just wanted to sleep and forget. It was meaningless. I had no purpose.',
        5: 'Of course not. I\'ve screwed up everything and made her feel bad. I don\'t care now what she thinks of me, but the fact that I can lose her. I don\'t know if I can pretend it\'s nothing. As if I had not made a mixture of pain and suffering along with the cynicism that invades my life. But I have to, for her. I will not allow her to be sad because of me.',
        6: 'I don\'t have anything. I can only pretend it never happened. I care more about her than myself. If I could, I would change everything that happened by avoiding my confession. Just because I thought of myself, I hurt her. It will be the last time, I promise.'
